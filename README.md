# Tanuki

Tanuki is a polyglot web framework that allows developers to write web applications and services in multiple programming languages. The basic concept is simple -- an acceptor, which is a HTTP server, accepts HTTP requests and redirects it to either an executable binary file (or script) or a TCP socket server to handle. These handlers can be written in different programming languages and run independently from each other.


## Why Tanuki?

It seems a bit of work to write a single web application in different programming languages, so why do it? It's really all about future-proofing.

### No more fighting

### Easy upgrade

### Switching technologies

### Modular replacement

### Easy testing
